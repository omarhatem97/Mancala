# Mancala
The Mancala board is made up of two rows of six pockets. Initially 4 stones are placed in each of the 12 pockets where each player has a store called Mancala to his right side of the Mancala board. The goal of the game is to collect the most pieces by the end.  

The game starts with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his side & counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out. If you run into your own Mancala, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and continue moving to the next pocket. If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn. 

You can play in stealing mode by doing so:  If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the pocket directly opposite and put it in your Mancala. 

 When all six pockets on one side of the Mancala board are empty the game ends. The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends, capture all of those pieces. Count all the pieces in each Mancala. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
